# Install and configure MapServer
Setting up the initial runtime environment when starting a job can be tedious, especially when following the step-by-step steps, but the basic "Hello World" still doesn't appear, and it can be maddening.
Building a running environment requires comprehensive technology, some experience, and a bit of luck. Don't underestimate the ability to configure the runtime environment. Many programmers cannot build a development environment by themselves, let alone a real production environment.

## Basic requirements for installing and configuring MapServer


MapServer is an open source software written in C language, which itself relies on some open source or free libraries, such as Shapelib, FreeType, Proj.4, GDAL/OGR, GD Library, Regex.
MapServer is written in C, and the sub-projects it depends on have corresponding C language implementation versions. When running MapServer, the relevant class libraries must be installed, and sometimes they also depend on specific versions of certain class libraries. When compiling and installing MapServer, you need to have a certain understanding of these libraries.

- Shapelib provides the ability to read, write and update data in the "ESRI Shapefile" format, and to modify the corresponding property file (.dbf);
- FreeType is a font rendering library, capable of rendering most vector and bitmap font formats, designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and as lightweight as possible without sacrificing performance and functionality;
- Proj.4 is a geographic projection library that provides a variety of projection definitions and interfaces;
- GDAL/OGR, GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is an open source raster spatial data conversion library under the X/MIT license. It utilizes an abstract data model to express the various file formats it supports. It also has a range of command line tools for data transformation and processing. OGR is a branch of the GDAL project, similar in function to GDAL, except that it provides support for vector data. There are many well-known GIS products that use the GDAL/OGR library, including ESRI's ArcGIS 9.3, Google Earth and the cross-platform GRASS GIS system.
- GD Library, generate images dynamically, supports most formats: JPEG, GIF, WEBP, XPM, BMP. Usually used to dynamically generate charts, pictures, thumbnails, etc., often used in the web environment;
- Regex, provides regular expression support for MapServer.

By understanding these libraries, you can simplify the installation process by reducing the number of features to install.
Even though you only install a basic version of MapServer, it still has the ability to create a powerful application. After you become familiar with MapServer, you can add other features you want.

MapServer itself is a program that generates maps, but provides a CGI interface (the operation of MapServer CGI depends on PHP), and related functions can be called through Web access.
So many times in order to run MapServer, you need to install a web server (such as Apache 2), and a tool (such as FastCGI) to let the application (MapServer) communicate with the web server (Apache). Apache 2 does not have CGI enabled by default.

![Libraries that MapServer depends on](zz_fig_gis_libs1.png)

### Required libraries:

1. GD Library: MapServer uses the GD graphics library to represent images in GIF, PNG and JPEG formats. These images are viewed on the browser via MapServer CGI.
1. Regex:Regex is a library of regular expressions.

### Optional libraries:

1. JPEG library: the JPEG image is generated by the GD call.
1. PNG library: the PNG image is generated by the GD call.
1. Zlib: used by libpng to provide graphics compression.
1. FreeType 2: by GD. Call to provide TrueType support.
1. PROJ.4:Proj.4 is used for dynamic projection transformation. WMS, WFS or WCS Services also need its support.
1. GDAL/OGR:MapServer uses the GDAL/OGR library to read data in raster (GDAL) and vector (OGR) format
1. ArcSDE:ArcSDE is ESRI's spatial database engine (it is not free) to support MapServer access to SDE databases.
1. EPPL7: used to read EPPL7 databases and older versions of Erdas LAN/GIS files. It serves as a built-in library for MapServer.

## Detailed introduction of MapServer related class libraries

### GD

GD is an image library. Since Mapserver uses GD for image rendering, it must be installed. GD has its own dependent class library, including zlib, libpng, FreeType2.x and libJPEG.
These types enable GD to perform image compression (for supported data), to render PNG images, to use TrueType fonts, and to render JPEG images. Since the license on GIF has expired, it is now available as well.

GD support has been removed in MapServer 7. 0.

### FreeType

FreeType is a font rendering engine. It is not referenced directly by Mapserver, but is used by GD to render fonts.
Since TrueType is more attractive than the bitmap fonts provided by Mapserver, it is worth including this class library.

### LibPNG

LibPNG enables Mapserver to render JPEG images. A new version has been released since 2001.
Generally speaking, this library should already be installed on the machine. If not, you can install it yourself. Libpng uses MapServer to render PNG images. It is not directly used by MapServer, but by GD. Libpng requires the library zlib.

### Zlib

Zlib is a data compression library used by GD.

### GDAL

GDAL is a conversion class library for raster data.
It provides import and projection of raster images with geographic projections.
You won't use those features in this book, but this library is necessary to install basic Mapserver.


### OGR

The OGR library provides the ability to read and write some vector formats.
In this book you will use some of the features provided by OGR.

### Proj.4

Proj.4 is a program for cartographic projection. It can be called by Mapserver, or it can be projected on the entire database alone.

### Shapelib

Shapelib is a C program to generate and process Shape files.
You can use the useful tools provided by this class library without having to write any C code yourself.
It has the contents of generating shape files (including DBF files) and destroying shape files and DBF files, and change the projection of the shape file. Some of these features are based on Proj.4.

### Libcurl

libcurl is a client library that supports FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, DICT, FILE and LDAP URL conversion. This library is required if you want to provide WMS support.
The WMS protocol is used to transmit map images and file data over the network. To keep the Mapserver environment simple, you don't have to install it.

### SDE client library

The SDE client library is part of ESRI's spatial data warehouse.
If you want Mapserver to access it, you need to compile the library.

### PostgreSQL client library

The PostgreSQL client library provides the ability to access PostGIS data using Mapserver.
They provide similar functionality to ESRI products, but they are not open source.

### Oracle Spatial client library

The Oracle Spatial client library enables users to access the Oracle Spatial Data Warehouse using MapServer. They provide similar functionality to ESRI products.

### Ming

Ming enables MapServer to create SWF videos. It can provide some interesting functions.

### PDFLib

It is also useful for PDFLib to be able to output in PDF format using MapServer.


## Installation under Debian / Ubuntu system

Debian / Ubuntu is my most commonly used Linux release, and its well-designed package management tool is really enjoyable.
To install MapServer, simply run the following installation command (administrator privileges are required):

In Debian 9:

    apt install -y apache2 php7.0 libapache2-mod-fcgid cgi-mapserver \
        mapserver-bin libapache2-mod-php
    a2enmod authnz_fcgi
    a2enmod cgi
    service apache2 restart

In Ubuntu 18.04:

    apt install -y apache2 php7.2 libapache2-mod-fcgid cgi-mapserver \
        mapserver-bin libapache2-mod-php
    a2enmod authnz_fcgi
    a2enmod cgi
    service apache2 restart

Almost no difference except the newer ``php 7.2`` version used in Ubuntu 18.04. When installing these packages, if the corresponding dependencies are missing, they will be installed automatically.

After the installation is complete, you can enter the following command on the terminal to view the results:

    $ mapserv -v
    MapServer version 7.0.4 OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=KML SUPPORTS=PROJ
        SUPPORTS=AGG SUPPORTS=FREETYPE SUPPORTS=CAIRO SUPPORTS=SVG_SYMBOLS

        SUPPORTS=WMS_CLIENT SUPPORTS=WFS_SERVER SUPPORTS=WFS_CLIENT 
        SUPPORTS=WCS_SERVER SUPPORTS=SOS_SERVER SUPPORTS=FASTCGI 
        SUPPORTS=THREADS SUPPORTS=GEOS INPUT=JPEG INPUT=POSTGIS 
        INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE


A little note about FastCGI.

CGI (Common Gateway Interface) defines the method of interaction between web server and external content generation program, which usually refers to CGI program or CGI script. It is the simplest and commonly used method to realize dynamic pages on the website, making the interaction between external program and web server possible.
But early CGI programs ran in separate processes and created a process for each web request. This method is very easy to implement, but inefficient and difficult to scale. In the face of a large number of requests, a large number of processes are created and killed, which greatly reduces the performance of the operating system. In addition, because the address space cannot be shared, resource reuse is also limited.

FastCGI uses persistent (daemon) processes to handle a chain of requests, these processes are managed by the FastCGI server, not the web server.
When a request comes in, the web server passes the environment variables and the page request to the FastCGI process through a socket, such as the FastCGI process and the web server (both locally), or a TCP connection (FastCGI process on the remote server farm) is passed to the FastCGI process.

## Installation under Windows system

To install MapServer under Windows, you also need to install Apache2, CGI, and MapServer programs, which also have binary packages under Windows, but such a step-by-step installation is more troublesome and prone to problems.
It is recommended to use ``MS4W`` (MapServer 4 Windows), the link is: [https://www.ms4w.com/](https://www.ms4w.com/) .
