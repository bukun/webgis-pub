# Getting started with Mapfile

## Do not use the "map" of the data

Let's take a look at the basic usage of MapServer without using any GIS data.

</div>


The image shown above is the code used:

     <img border="1" src="http://{IP}/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/owg/xmfa0.map&mode=map"/>

## Basic usage of Mapfile

In MapServer, to generate the above image, the Mapfile code used is:

->-> xmfa0.map

Layer objects are defined below the map object. Before you can display a map, you need to define at least one layer in your map file. You can define as many layers as you want in MapServer. By default, the upper limit of the number of layers is defined in the source code map.h and is limited to 100. This restriction can be removed by modifying the source code, but there seems to be no reason to do so.
