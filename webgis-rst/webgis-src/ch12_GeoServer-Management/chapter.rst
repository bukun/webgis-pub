Explore the management interface
================================

In this hands-on chapter, we will explore that the interface has been
significantly improved in GeoSever 2.15.2.x admin interface series.

An enhanced interface to the integrated GeoWebCache is available in
2.15. You can now perform almost any cache configuration from the
GeoServer interface.

In addition, the security interface has been updated to track
significant improvements in the GeoServer security module. The good news
is that we will use the mouse more here than in any other chapter, so
the keyboard will not be used for the time being. Letâ€™s get started. Log
in.
