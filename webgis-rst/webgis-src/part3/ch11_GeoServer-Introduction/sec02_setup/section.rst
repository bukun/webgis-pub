Install and configure GeoServer
===============================

GeoServer is an open source server for sharing geospatial data.
GeoServer implements industry standard OGC protocols such as Web Feature
Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS).
Additional formats and publishing options are available as extensions,
including Web Processing Service (WPS) and Web Map Tile Service (WMTS).
Both can be published using GeoServer as a server. Before using the
GeoServer server, you need to download and install another web server
tomcat. Someone may have already installed it, but it needs to be
configured.

Configure tomcat
----------------

Tomcat server is a free and open source web application server, which is
a lightweight application server. It is commonly used in small and
medium-sized systems and occasions where there are not many concurrent
access users. In fact, Tomcat is an extension of Apache server, but the
runtime It runs standalone, so when you run tomcat, it actually runs as
a separate process from Apache.

Configuration process:

-  Install JDK
-  Download and install tomcat
-  Modify the configuration file

Download address of Tomcat:

::

   https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi

Currently the latest version of Tomcat is 9.0.27. Readers are free to
download

Use console commands to operate after the download is complete

::

   cd dir/apache-tomcat-7.0.94/bin
   ./start.sh  

Open the browser address bar to enter

::

   localhost:8080

The following page indicates that the configuration is successful:

   :alt: Tomcat configured successfully

   Tomcat configured successfully

Letâ€™s go ahead and modify the configuration file:

First, set the user name and password, add security, and configure the
file address.

::

   cd dir/apache-tomcat-7.0.94/conf
   vi tomcat-user.xml

There is a tomcat-user.xmlwen file opened in the file and added at the
end of the file. Set the login account password to ``admin``, ``tomcat``

   Tomcat configuration password

Next, modify web.xml, and change the file size from 50MB to 80MB,
because the size of GeoServer will exceed 50MB, you can configure
GeoServer after the configuration is complete.

::

   cd dir/apache-tomcat-7.0.94/webapps/manager/WEB-INF
   vi web.xml

.. figure:: ./tomcat_conf2.png

Restart tomcat after completion, and the server needs to be restarted
each time the configuration file is modified.

Download and install GeoServer
------------------------------

Download address:

::

   http://geoserver.org/download/

Download the .war file and .bin file, here we mainly use the .war file
as an example to decompress and copy the files to the webapps folder as
shown in the figure.

   Geoserver installation

Now you can enter the browser and use it. Open the browser to enter.

::

   localhost:8080

Click manager app

.. figure:: ./geoserver_2.png
   :alt: Manager enters

   Manager enters

Click on geoserver.war

.. figure:: ./geoserver_3.png
   :alt: Geoserver enters

   Geoserver enters

Username and password can be set at the same time

The installation and configuration of Geoserver has been completed, and
the next article focuses on the use of Geoserver in conjunction with
other applications.
