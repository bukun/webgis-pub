WebGIS related standards and specifications
===========================================

WebGIS service standards are the basis of modern WebGIS technology.

In order to realize the interoperability of spatial data and promote the
sharing of spatial data among heterogeneous platforms, OGC (Open
Geospatial Consortium, Open Geospatial Consortium) has been committed to
providing standardization of software, data and services in the
geographic information industry, and has formulated a series of spatial
The service specification of the data, such as WMS, WMTS, WFS, etc.
Based on the OGC standard specification, the global sharing and
interoperability of geographic information has become an inevitable
trend in the development of GIS technology. Therefore, at present, most
of the open map service resources are released based on the OGC service
specification, providing standard OGC map services to the public.
