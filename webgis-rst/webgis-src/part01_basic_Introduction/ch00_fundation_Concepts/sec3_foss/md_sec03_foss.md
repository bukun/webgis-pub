# Introduction to major open source WebGIS

WebGIS is composed of four parts, and it can be seen from the name that it includes at least Web and GIS, which involves technical complexity. From the perspective of WebGIS, open source tools can be divided into two categories: component products and full-stack products.


## Free and open source software, open specification and open data


At present, the use and maintenance costs of commercial GIS software are getting higher and higher. For example, a complete set of ESRI ArcGIS software including client and server is priced at about 700,000 yuan. And its sales strategy is that if you buy server-side software, you must buy client-side software. The reason is that since users use their server-side software to publish services, they must use their client-side software to process data. This is far beyond the affordable range for some relatively small WebGIS applications. And many commercial software GIS data and operations are not completely able to convert and share, resulting in some information islands.

But on the opposite side of commercial GIS software is open source GIS. Founded in 1994, OGC is committed to researching and establishing open geographic data interoperability standards, enabling users and developers to interoperate. The International Geospatial Development Foundation (Open Source Geospatial Foundation) was established in February 2006. Its mission is to support the development of open source geographic information software and remote sensing software and promote their wider application, provide organizational, legal and financial assistance for the projects it supports, and promote the development, promotion and popularization of OSGeo Foundation's standard software based on geographic information and its Interoperability Technology.

### Free and open source GIS software


Free and open source software is a type of computer software that can be classified as both free software and open source software. That is, anyone who is licensed is free to use, copy, research, and modify the software in any way, and its source code is open and shared, so people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. Such software is in contrast to commercial software, which is under strict copyright restrictions and whose source code is generally not available to users.

At present, there are many free and open source GIS software including various levels. For example, large desktop GIS includes QGIS and grass GIS. Currently the more popular server-side software includes GeoServer, MapServer and QGIS server, as well as open source GIS database projects such as PostGIS / PostgreSQL spatial database, In addition, there are some open source projects such as data conversion tools (such as GDAL / ogr) and map projection algorithm libraries (such as proj and geotrans). Most of these software are supported by osgeo.


### The role of open data


Open data is a type of data that can be freely used, reused, and redistributed by anyone. Among its limitations, at best, requires attribution and redistribution using a similar protocol. Data.gov contains a lot of open data collected by the U.S. government. In addition, OpenStreetMap (OSM for short) is also a widely used open data source. The OSM project was founded by British Steve Coast. The concept was inspired by the Wikipedia website. It is an online map collaboration project for building free content, the goal is to create a free-content map of the world that can be edited by anyone, with an easy-to-navigate solution for cheap mobile devices.


## Components of WebGIS


Four components of WebGIS: WebGIS Application Development and GIS Services

1. Client
1. Web Services and Application Services
1. GIS service
1. Data service

Client: The client is where the user interacts with spatial objects and analysis functions in Web GIS. It is also where Internet GIS programs present their output to the user.

Web Servers and Application Servers: Web servers respond to requests from web browsers via HTTP. When the web server passes requests to other programs, it requests services from the application server. The application server acts as a translator or connector between the web server and the GIS server.

GIS server: GIS server is a main component, which can complete spatial query, perform spatial analysis, and generate and provide maps to clients according to user's request.

Data Servers: Data servers provide spatial and non-spatial data in relational or non-relational database structures. In this website, we pay special attention to GIS server as well as client application. Many GIS servers are on the internet such as GeoServer, MapServer, Mapnik, MapGuide, QGIS Server, etc. All of these servers are open source servers, i.e. freely available. ArcGIS also provides a server, but it is not freely available but has many additional features. All open source servers are free to download from their respective websites.


<!--
Client: The client is a place for users to interact with spatially object and analysis functions in web GIS. It is also a place for Internet GIS programs to present outputs to the users.
Web server and application server: The web server responds to request from web browser via HTTP. When the web server passes the requests to other programs, it requests service from application servers. An application server acts as a translator or connector between the web server and the GIS server.
GIS server: A GIS server is a major workhorse component that fulfills spatial queries, conducts spatial analysis, and generates and delivers maps to the client based on the user's request.
Data server: A data server serves data, spatial and non-spatial, in a relational or non-relational database structure.
In this post we are focusing particularly on GIS servers. There are many GIS servers available on the internet such as GeoServer, MapServer, Mapnik, MapGuide, QGIS server etc. All these servers are open source servers i.e. Freely available. ArcGIS also provides server but it is not available for free, but with many add on features. All the open source servers can be freely downloaded from their respective websites.

### PostGIS


PostGIS is an extension to the PostgreSQL database that supports spatial queries. PostgreSQL is both a relational and object database and is widely regarded as the most advanced open source database, similar to Oracle and MS-SQL. PostGIS supports various spatial queries including proximity, radius, bounding box, collision/overlap detection, etc. It is a very useful tool that is often used in Web GIS projects.

### OpenLayers

<!--
OpenLayers is a front-end UI library for creating web-based spatial apps

For example, map tiles can be pulled from GoogleMaps or from a custom tile source.
The advantage this brings is that it enables developers to reuse elements
Such as tile sources, and focus instead on the more unique aspects
Of their application such as the "business logic".
Default components such as tile sources can easily be swapped out at a later time.
It supports bitmap and vector layers, including points, lines and polygons.
One of its most widely used features is the ability to overlay data layers
On top of base maps.

### GeoDjango

<!--
GeoDjango is a set of spatial extensions for the Django application framework.
Django is written primarily in Python and is one
Of the most popular general-purpose frameworks
For building web apps with Python. Unlike GeoMoose or MapGuide
It does not provide an application out of the box
And is rather a set of very nicely crafted building blocks
For building custom applications.
Unlike some of the other stack products described above
It makes less assumptions about which other geospatial tools will be used in the stack
And provides integration points through a series of clearly-designed
Well-documented APIs.
It will likely appeal to developers who want more choice
And control in the building of their applications
As well as those who prefer the Python language.
