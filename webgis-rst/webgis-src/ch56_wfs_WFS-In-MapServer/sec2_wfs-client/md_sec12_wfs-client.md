; Title: Use MapServer as a WFS client

# Use MapServer as the WFS client


WFS can be added as a layer in MapServer. In this way, it is used as a WFS client.

Since WFS needs to transfer data over the network, it is best to use smaller amounts of data. 
The selection here is to use point feature data.

## Writting way of MapFile  

->-> mft6.map


## Example effect

The effect is:

Note that the above graph is a traditional MapServer generated map. Defined by the WFS point layer in front, so it's mostly occluded by polygons.
