## Online operating environment

In order to facilitate learning and use, an online running environment is established in this section, and the more complex case configurations in the book are run. The original book was published in 2005. Up to now, MapServer has undergone major changes, and some modifications are inevitable in order to run. In addition, for the convenience of use, some text descriptions will also be added.
